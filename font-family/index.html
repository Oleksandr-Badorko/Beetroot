              React Native is an open source framework for building Android and
              iOS applications using React and the app platform’s native
              capabiles.With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
              platform’s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior
              of your UI using React

              React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library
              for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of
              React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section
              can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.

              We're going to cover the core concepts behind React:

              <b>+ components</b>. The rest of this introduction to React uses
              cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need
              names and a cafe to work in.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph_item">
              <b>+ JSX.</b> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets
              you write elements inside JavaScript like so:
              <span class="grey"> Hello, I am your cat! &ltText&gt. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph_item">
              The React docs have a <u>comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can
              refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use
              variables inside it. Here you are declaring a
              <span class="grey">name</span> for the cat, name, and embedding it
              with curly braces inside <span class="grey">&ltText&gt</span>
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph_item">
              <b>+ props.</b> Props is short for “properties”.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph_item">
              <b>+ state.</b> While you can think of props as arguments you use
              to configure how components render, state is like a component’s
              personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that
              changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives
              your components memory!

              TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text.
              It has an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called
              every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that
              takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph_item">
              For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
              their words into a different language. In this new language, every
              single word is written the same way:
              <i class="fa-solid fa-pizza-slice"></i>. So the sentence "Hello
              there Bob" would be translated as "<i
                class="fa-solid fa-pizza-slice"
              ></i
              ><i class="fa-solid fa-pizza-slice"></i>".
